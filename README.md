This is the code that Amy Cotton, Amy Wichelow and Josh Kelvin have written.

It appears that I, Amy Cotton have done all of the code but I was in charge of uploading to our repository. 
This means that Amy Wichelow has also contributed to the code equally but we worked together on most things so I only 1 person needed to upload to the repostiory.
Our blogs are more clear on the specific aspects of the code we have written indidually.
